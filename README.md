# Max Patches
This repository stores files that allow you to do insertions using [Max/MSP](https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/). 

These patches require [Syphon for Jitter](https://github.com/Syphon/Jitter) package. Make sure you install the package (available on Max's Package Manager, and via Github), before using playing around with this code.

Because [Syphon is OS X only](http://syphon.v002.info/), these patches will only work on OS X.

## File description
1. **empty-input-output-example.maxpat:** An empty example file for you to modify.To create a custom insetion using this file, you'll just need to modify the object called [what-you-want];
2. **crazy-effect.maxpat:** A simple example of an insertion built in Max; 
3. **Syphon:* Folder containing [Syphon for Jitter](https://github.com/Syphon/Jitter) package. This folder is a copy of the Github repository. ;
4. **jitter-effects:** Folder containing some example of VJ-like video effects in Jitter (that could be potentially applied to insertions);

Have fun!
